# **Pain Point Analysis Summary**

The Reddit data reveals significant frustrations with existing net worth tracking solutions, particularly around geographic limitations, security concerns, complexity/usability issues, and the gap between simple tracking and advanced financial analysis. Users consistently express dissatisfaction with available tools and resort to manual spreadsheet solutions despite their limitations.

# **Categorized Pain Points**

## **Geographic Limitations and Localization Issues**

### Lack of UK/Non-US Focused Solutions

Users struggle to find net worth tracking tools designed for their specific country's financial system and institutions.

- "I've seen some PowerBI, Excel, Google sheet ones, but nearly all of them are American based, or WAY overcomplicated."
- "Just wondered what people use for tracking their Networth? Ideally i'd like a web app that uses manually inputted data that I can update once a month or once a quarter or every 6 months."
- "Any good net worth trackers in the UK?"

**Frequency/Intensity:** High frequency across UK-based subreddits, with users specifically calling out this as a primary barrier to adoption.

## **Security and Privacy Concerns**

### Fear of Account Compromise Through Third-Party Apps

Users experience legitimate security breaches or fear connecting financial accounts to tracking applications.

- "This morning I received multiple texts and emails about someone using my TD HELOC, unsecured LOC, draining my checkings account and using the overdraft protection. I went to the branch immediately and thankfully TD had blocked all the attempts and nothing was actually done. However, the only thing I can think of is Wealthica connecting to all my accounts."
- "Please use this as a warning for those budgeting and networth tracking apps. I will only be using Google Sheets from now on and doing it all manually because it is not worth it."
- "This could have turned out to be my entire life savings gone over the convenience of using a networth tracker/budgeting tool."

**Frequency/Intensity:** Very high intensity with users completely abandoning automated solutions after security incidents.

## **Complexity and Usability Problems**

### Tools Are Either Too Simple or Overwhelmingly Complex

Users can't find solutions that hit the sweet spot between functionality and ease of use.

- "I've seen some PowerBI, Excel, Google sheet ones, but nearly all of them are American based, or WAY overcomplicated."
- "Now that Mint switched me over to Credit Karma and it's awful, would love to know if other apps are working for any of you!"
- "I feel like I'm stuck in a loop and need a sanity check. I pay for a premium tool to get all my accounts in one place, which is great for a high-level net worth number. But the second I want to do any real analysis, like calculate my actual portfolio return (TWRR/IRR) or model a couple of different FIRE scenarios, I have to dump everything into a massive, custom-built spreadsheet."

**Frequency/Intensity:** High frequency with strong emotional language expressing frustration with existing solutions.

### Lack of Visual Appeal and Motivation

Current tracking methods don't provide the visual feedback needed to stay motivated about financial progress.

- "Currently, I'm just using 3 tables in Excel (Liabilites, Assets, Networth) with breakdown of percentage held in each asset. It's ok, but not very motivating to look at (to see previous growth)."
- "I'd basically like it to look like the snowball analytics app, but for networth."

**Frequency/Intensity:** Moderate frequency but high importance for user engagement and motivation.

## **Manual Data Entry Burden**

### Constant Spreadsheet Maintenance is Exhausting

Users resort to spreadsheets but find them time-consuming and difficult to maintain.

- "So now I have this clunky, two-part system: a paid app that pulls the data, and a spreadsheet I have to constantly babysit to do the thinking. The spreadsheet is powerful, but honestly, it's a huge pain to keep updated and it's ugly as hell."
- "The spreadsheet is powerful, but honestly, it's a huge pain to keep updated and it's ugly as hell."
- "I have an obsession with tracking my networth. Around the 15th of every month I update our cash accounts, retirement accounts, mortgage balances, and brokerage accounts and have been doing it since 2013."

**Frequency/Intensity:** High frequency with users expressing frustration about time investment while simultaneously being unwilling to give up control.

## **Gap Between Simple Tracking and Advanced Analysis**

### Need for Both Basic Tracking and Sophisticated Financial Planning

Users want simple net worth tracking but also need advanced features for FIRE planning and portfolio analysis.

- "I feel like I'm stuck in a loop and need a sanity check. I pay for a premium tool to get all my accounts in one place, which is great for a high-level net worth number. But the second I want to do any real analysis, like calculate my actual portfolio return (TWRR/IRR) or model a couple of different FIRE scenarios, I have to dump everything into a massive, custom-built spreadsheet."
- "How are you bridging the gap between your daily finances and your long-term FIRE plan without it being a massive chore?"
- "Am I the only one doing this? What does your actual workflow look like?"

**Frequency/Intensity:** Very high intensity in FIRE communities where users need both basic tracking and advanced planning capabilities.

## **Lack of Community and Social Validation**

### Isolation in Financial Tracking Efforts

Users feel alone in their detailed financial tracking habits and seek community with like-minded individuals.

- "Now that I hit the 10 year mark of doing this I'm truly amazed at the progress my wife and I have made, but I also realized that NO ONE else in my regular life does this. But this might be the right support group."
- "Does anyone else obsess over spreadsheets? What have you put together that has been beneficial?"

**Frequency/Intensity:** Moderate frequency but high emotional impact, with users seeking validation and community around their financial tracking practices.

# **Priority Ranking**

1. **Security and Privacy Concerns** - Highest priority due to potential for complete user abandonment and real financial harm

3. **Gap Between Simple Tracking and Advanced Analysis** - High priority in FIRE communities where sophisticated planning is essential

# **Executive Summary**

The net worth tracking market reveals a significant opportunity for solutions that prioritize security, regional customization, and the balance between simplicity and sophistication. Current solutions fail to serve non-US markets effectively, create security anxieties, and force users into either overly simple or overwhelmingly complex tools. The opportunity lies in creating regionally-focused, security-first solutions that can scale from basic tracking to advanced financial planning while fostering community engagement.

I need to implement Trading 212 integration for my Next.js/Supabase net worth tracker app. Here's what needs to be built:

## 1. Add Asset Card Enhancement

- Add a shadcn callout component to the existing "Add Asset" card
- Callout should say "Connect Account" and link to the Settings page in the sidebar

## 2. Settings Page - Connect Accounts Section

- Create/enhance the Settings page with a new "Connect Accounts" section
- Add a "Connect Account" button that opens a modal
- Modal should show a list of available third-party accounts (currently only Trading 212)

## 3. Trading 212 Connection Flow

- When Trading 212 is clicked, open a new modal with:
  - Input field for Trading 212 API key
  - Info callout directing users to Trading 212 docs: https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/14584770928157-How-can-I-generate-an-API-key
  - "Connect" button

## 4. Secure API Key Storage

- Create a new Supabase table called `encrypted_credentials` with columns:
  - id (UUID, primary key)
  - user_id (UUID, references auth.users)
  - encrypted_trading212_key (TEXT)
  - salt (TEXT)
  - iv (TEXT)
  - auth_tag (TEXT)
  - created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- Enable Row Level Security with policy: users can only access their own credentials
- Create API endpoint `/api/credentials/store` that encrypts and stores the API key using AES-256-GCM encryption with the user's session as the encryption key
- After successful storage, show success modal and redirect to dashboard

## 5. Trading 212 Portfolio Integration

- Add new entry on the assets page showing current value of all user's stocks from Trading 212
- Use Trading 212 API: https://t212public-api-docs.redoc.ly/
- Specifically use the `/api/v0/equity/portfolio` endpoint to get portfolio data

## 6. Daily Caching System

- Create a new Supabase table called `portfolio_cache` with columns:
  - id (UUID, primary key)
  - user_id (UUID, references auth.users)
  - trading212_data (JSONB)
  - total_value (DECIMAL)
  - last_fetched (TIMESTAMPTZ)
  - created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- When user visits dashboard page:
  - Check if Trading 212 data was fetched today for this user
  - If not fetched today, make API call to Trading 212, decrypt the stored API key, fetch portfolio data, and save to cache
  - If already fetched today, use cached data
  - Display the total portfolio value in the assets list

## 7. API Endpoints Needed

- `POST /api/credentials/store` - Encrypt and store Trading 212 API key
- `GET /api/credentials/decrypt` - Decrypt stored API key for API calls
- `GET /api/trading212/portfolio` - Fetch and cache portfolio data
- `GET /api/assets` - Enhanced to include Trading 212 portfolio value

## Technical Requirements

- Use shadcn/ui components for all UI elements
- Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- Use crypto module for AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption
- Ensure all database operations use RLS
- Follow Next.js 13+ app router patterns
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement loading states for all async operations

## Security Notes

- Never log or expose API keys in any form
- Use environment variables for encryption secrets
- Implement proper error messages without exposing sensitive information
- Ensure all database queries are parameterized

Please implement this step by step, creating all necessary files, database schemas, API routes, and UI components. Test the integration thoroughly and provide clear error handling throughout the flow.
