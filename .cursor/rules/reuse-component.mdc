# Rule: Always use existing components when available

## Match
.*

## Reuse Components
- When creating UI elements such as **buttons, inputs, cards, or modals**, always check if a reusable component already exists in the codebase.
- Prefer using the available `Button` component (e.g. `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`) rather than writing new button markup.
- Maintain consistency by reusing **props and styling conventions** already defined in the component (e.g. `variant`, `size`, `className`).
- If a new variant or prop is needed, **extend the existing component**, do not duplicate it.
- When creating new components, **store them in the appropriate `/components` directory** and ensure they follow project naming conventions.

## Example
- ✅ Correct:
  ```tsx
  import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

  <Button variant="gradient" size="lg">
    Contact Me
  </Button>
````

* ❌ Incorrect:

  ```tsx
  <button className="bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-500 to-purple-500 px-4 py-2 text-white rounded">
    Contact Me
  </button>
  ```

## Enforcement

* This rule applies to **all UI creation tasks**, especially buttons, forms, and repeatable patterns.
* Ensure **consistent branding, accessibility, and styling** by reusing components across the entire app.
