**When:** I give you a command that starts with `commit "` or `push "` and ends with a closing quote, like `commit "feat: add new login component"`.

**Then:**
1.  **Extract the commit message.** The message is the text between the double quotes.

2.  **Execute the following shell commands in sequence:**
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m "{message}"` (where `{message}` is the extracted commit message from step 1).
    * `git push`

3. Fix all build or lint errors
